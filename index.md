# NASA SBIR - Unmanned Traffic Management for 24 Hour Wildfire Operations
The UTM project builds on Trident Sensing's real-time wildfire mapping technologies to incorporate wildfire airspace control, retardant dropping guidance, and real-time tasking of aerial assets from a single ground station. The final product will allow for a single wildfire controller to request areas of a wildfire to be mapped and for  retardant firebreaks to be dropped at precision locations all from a single georeferenced map using a touch interface. 

The project is 6 months in duration, with an anticipated start date in **late June, going until December**. The expected time commitment will be **two to three days a week** for most positions throughout the summer, with **fewer hours as the school semester begins** in the fall. Most days would be in person at the **Ogden-Hinckley airport**, with potential for remote work depending on project requirements (many of our development tasks involve integrating with lab hardware, which can be difficult to bring home).

This project is perfect for those who are interested in aviation, applied photography, computer vision, or distributed systems. See the listings below for this project.

We are looking to hire as soon as possible, but could be interested in personnel depending on availability throughout the summer.

## Software Engineer 1 / Computer Engineer 1 Summer/Fall 2022
This project involves two major software development efforts:

The first is a **front-end** oriented position, which would focus on improving a python/tkinter based GUI which implements avionics symbology, and collaborating to create a suite of tools that the ground operator would interact with - most likely in an interactive web environment. We are looking for developers who are comfortable with concurrent systems interaction, and experience with GUI design and structure, ideally with an emphasis on interactivity.

The second is a **back-end** development position, which would focus on data flow between aircraft and the ground control station, developing algorithms for deconflicting airspace, and implementing aircraft guidance methods. This position requires a person who is interested in doing more than just software design, and is comfortable with deriving solutions to real-world problems which may require intermediate math skills.

Requirements:
* Near completion of their BS CS or CE (fourth or fifth year student), have completed their BS CS or CE, or are currently enrolled in a graduate coursework program.
* Comfortable with Linux command line operations, developing through the command line, and remote shell.
* Comfortable with command line git version control.
* Experience with C++, Python, and familiarity with JS/Type Script.

Nice to haves (**frontend** position)
* Experience implementing a website from scratch, and interfacing with databases and other backend data sources.
* Experience with the Google Maps API.
* Experience with the tkinter GUI library.
* Aviation knowledge, potentially through a pilot's license. 

Nice to haves (**backend** position)
* Completed an operating systems course or distributed systems course.
* Experience with Raspberry Pi development.
* Experience with Software Defined Radios or ADS-B.
* Experience with satellite links (iridium or similar).
* Experience with remote procedure calls (GRPC or similar).
* Aviation knowledge, potentially through a pilot's license. 

Contact: jobs@tridentsensing.com, with a copy of your resume and portfolio/website (optional) to apply. No cover letter is needed, but if you would like you can highlight some of your strengths that you think are applicable to the project in the email.

Recommended deadline: 6/14/2022, 6/07/2022 preferred.

## Software Development Internship Summer/Fall 2022
This position would be focused on collaborating with the engineering team to develop core capabilities, and independently developing integration testing methods for the system. The integrated testing would consist of interfacing with aircraft simulation programs (such as X-Plane or MFS), and writing data translators that would accept simulated aircraft parameters and output data messages over RS232 or similar to feed the system under test. This team member would also work with the mechanical engineering team to design a simulator station for more effective testing of avionics.

Requirements:
* Currently pursuing a degree in either Computer Science or Computer Engineering and have completed coursework up to CS 4400 or further.
* Experience with sockets, UDP, and multithreading.
* Comfortable with Linux command line operations, developing through the command line, and remote shell.
* Comfortable with python, and C-style languages.

Nice to haves:
* Experience with Serial busses such as UART or SPI.
* Experience with flight simulator programs, and interfacing with them (X-Plane datarefs preferred).
* Aviation knowledge, potentially through a pilot's license.

Recommended deadline: 6/14/2022, 6/07/2022 preferred.

## Mechanical Engineering Internship Summer/Fall 2022
This position would be focused on two major components. The first would consist of modifying an existing firemapping sensor design to fit into a new aircraft platform. This would involve surveying the new platform, modifying Solidworks models to fit the new platform, manufacturing the new sensor using 3D printed parts, and verifying the suitability of the new design. The second would consist of designing and manufacturing a flight simulator platform, most likely out of t-slot, that would mount flight controls, monitors, and prototype avionics.

Requirements:
* Very comfortable with Solidworks, including complex reference geometry - a lot of this work is focused around spherical geometry, which can be tricky.
* Comfortable with 3D printing, and designing parts with the intention to 3D print. 
* Comfortable with shop tools, including basic metal work.
* Experience creating basic diagrams from a model.

Nice to haves:
* Experience with the prusa platform and slicer.
* Experience with t-slot, or other modular rail systems.
* Aircraft knowledge, such as AMP experience.
