# NASA SBIR Listings - Unmanned Traffic Management
The UTM project builds on Trident Sensing's real-time wildfire mapping technologies to incorporate wildfire airspace control, retardant dropping guidance, and real-time tasking of aerial assets from a single ground station. The final product will allow for a single wildfire controller to request areas of a wildfire to be mapped and for  retardant firebreaks to be dropped at precision locations all from a single georeferenced map using a touch interface. 

The project is a short duration, with an anticipated start date in late June, going until September. Hours would be two to three days a week for most positions throughout the summer, with fewer hours as the school semester begins in the fall. Most days would be in person at the Ogden-Hinckley airport, with potential for remote work depending on project requirements (many of our development tasks involve integrating with lab hardware, which can be difficult to bring home).

This project is perfect for those who are interested in aviation, applied photography, computer vision, or distributed systems. 

## Software Development Internship Summer/Fall 2022


## Software Engineer 1 Summer/Fall 2022
What you would be developing: 

This project involves two major software development efforts:
* The first is a front-end oriented position, which would focus on improving a python/tkinter based GUI which implements avionics symbology, and collaborating to create a suite of tools that the ground operator would interact with - most likely in an interactive web environment. We are looking for developers who are comfortable with concurrent systems interaction, and experience with GUI design and structure, ideally with an emphasis on interactivity.
* The second is a back-end development position, which would focus on communication between aircraft and the ground control station, developing algorithms for deconflicting airspace, and calculating ballistics profiles for retardant drop prediction. This position requires a person who is interested in doing more than just software design, and is comfortable with deriving solutions to real-world problems which may require intermediate math skills.

Requirements:
* Near completion of their BS CS (fourth or fifth year student), have completed their BS CS, or are currently enrolled in a graduate coursework program.
* Comfortable with Linux command line operations, and developing through the command line.
* Comfortable with command line git version control.
* Experience with C++, Python, and familiarity with JS/Type Script.

Nice to haves:
* Completed an operating systems course or distributed systems course.
* Experience with Raspberry Pi development.
* Experience with
