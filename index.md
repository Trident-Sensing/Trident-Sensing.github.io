# NASA SBIR Listings - Unmanned Traffic Management
The UTM project builds on Trident Sensing's real-time wildfire mapping technologies to incorporate wildfire airspace control, retardant dropping guidance, and real-time tasking of aerial assets from a single ground station. The final product will allow for a single wildfire controller to request areas of a wildfire to be mapped and for  retardant firebreaks to be dropped at precision locations all from a single georeferenced map using a touch interface. 

The project is a short duration, with an anticipated start date in late June, going until September. Hours would be two to three days a week for most positions throughout the summer, with fewer hours as the school semester begins in the fall. Most days would be in person at the Ogden-Hinckley airport, with potential for remote work depending on project requirements (many of our development tasks involve integrating with lab hardware, which can be difficult to bring home).

This project is perfect for those who are interested in aviation, applied photography, computer vision, or distributed systems.
